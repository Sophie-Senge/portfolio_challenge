## Overview

The project was to build a portfolio design using the things I have learned in the first two weeks of bootcamp. 

### The challenge

The most challenging aspect of this project for me was determining the best way to lay out the project combining CSS Grid and CSS flex.

## My Processs
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working through layout issues I developed a much better understanding of the concepts and principals of CSS Grid and CSS Flex, how they function, and how to make them work together to achieve a layout similar to the one in the challenge. I was also able to successfully implement media query to apply different styles for different devices.


### Continued development

Once I have work to showcase, I will need to replace the placeholder images and text and turn them into links. I used this design to challenge myself to replicate the one given to me in the Bootcamp, but in the future I'd like to play with the layout and come up with my own desing.
